    "In class, we discussed about logistic regression, and how it can be useful as a classification algorithm. In this problem set, we get some hands-on practice by implementing logistic regression on a Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset. Note that for this problem set, you should only be using the scikit-learn (sklearn) library for the last part (Tasks 5.x) on SVM.\n",

    "Similar to PS0, your implementation in the following tasks **should NOT involve any iteration, including `map` and `filter`, or recursion**. Instead, you should work with the operations available in NumPy. Solutions that violate this will be penalised.\n",

    "- You are allowed to use any mathematical functions, but this does not mean that you are allowed to use any NumPy function (there are NumPy functions that arenâ€™t mathematical functions). For example, `np.vectorize` is not allowed since it is iterative. If you are in doubt about which functions are allowed, you should ask in the forum.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is, however, an exception for **Tasks 3.4 and 3.5**. In the pseudo-code for the algorithm required, there is an explicit for loop. Hence, only for these task you may use **a single for/while loop** to iterate for the number of epochs required."

    "Fraudulent credit card transaction is a common phenomenon in many parts of the world and can lead to potentially large amounts of losses for both companies and customers. Therefore, we hope to help credit card companies recognize those fraudulent transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are given a dataset that contains transactions made by credit cards holders in `credit_card.csv`. If we think about what type of data might be included in the input variables under the given context, we might realize that those input variables are likely to include word descriptions, such as shop name or locations. In this problem set, we don't need to worry about language processing as the data are pre-processed to contain only numeric values."

    "[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is an open source data analysis and manipulation tool in Python. In this problem set, we read the CSV into a [Pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) to provide some nifty methods that makes it easier for us to handle large amounts of data. You can think of a dataframe as a large table that stores our dataset in a neat and optimized manner, making it fast for retrieval and manipulation and data. Using Pandas, we can quickly gain an overview of the type and values of the data stored, distributions of values within the dataset, and even ways to perform sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the new few sections, we will explore some basic functions of Pandas to help us get started. You do not need to submit any codes for this section, and can simply run the cells to follow along."

    "## Support Vector Machine\n",

    "Now let's apply the support vector machine we learnt in lecture to the credit card dataset. Here is a quick recap of what SVM is about: We are given a training dataset of $n$ points of the form $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$, where the $y^{(i)}$ are either 1 or 0, each indicating the class to which the point $x^{(i)}$ belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $x^{(i)}$ $n$-dimensional real vector. We want to find the \"maximum-margin hyperplane\" that divides the group of points $x^{(i)}$ for which $y_{i}=1$ from the group of points for which $y_{i}=0$, which is defined so that the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest point $x^{(i)}$ from either group is maximized.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/svm.png\" alt=\"visualisation of support vector machine\" width=\"50%\">\n",
    "<figcaption style=\"text-align:center\">Figure 7: Visualisation of support vector machine.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we do construct such a \"maximum-margin hyperplane\"? Recall that in the lecture, we formulated SVMs as the following minimization problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\min_{w} C \\left[\\sum_{i = 1}^{m} y^{(i)}\\ Cost_1(\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)})\\ Cost_0(\\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\\right] + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\mathbf{w}_i^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Cost_1(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \\max(0, 1 - \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$ and $Cost_0(\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) = \\max(0, 1 + \\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}^{(i)})$, with the hypothesis function $h_\\mathbf{w}(\\mathbf{w}) = 1$ if $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x} \\geq 0$, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the summand term is known as the *hinge loss*. Thus, when $y^{(i)} = 0$, the more negative $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ is, the more $Cost_1$ penalises the model. Similarly, $Cost_0$ penalises the model the further $\\mathbf{w}^T \\mathbf{x}$ strays from the negative region. Notice how the cost function aligns with the goal of the hypothesis function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we also add a regularization parameter $C$ to the cost function to balance the trade-off between margin maximization and loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, solving this minimization problem allows us to find the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ that provides the maximum-margin hyperplane while balancing the trade-off of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this set up in mind, how can we implement this in code? Thankfully, with modern machine learning libraries, much of the tedious work of solving this minimization problem has been done. As machine learning practitioners, one popular library that we commonly use (aside from [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)) is [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), which is built on top of NumPy and provides simple and efficient tools to implement common machine learning algorithms.\n",
