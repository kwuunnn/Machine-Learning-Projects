Computer Vision, the field that aims to make computers understand and learn visual objects like images, is a hot topic in Machine Learning.

You will be building a __Convolutional Neural Network__ (CNN/ConvNet) and training it on two datasets, *MNIST* and *CIFAR-10*. You'll also learn how to build __data augmentation pipelines__ to enhance your dataset. Finally, you'll look through the eyes of your ConvNet to see __why__ it's making certain predictions."

    "## Concept 2: Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dropout__ (*Srivastava et al., 2014*) is a regularisation technique that randomly shuts off neurons in a given layer. This means the output of the neuron is __zero__. As users, we need to specify a probability value `p` that is the probability of a neuron being shut off or not; there's a $p$ chance of a neuron being shut off.\n",

    "### Why Dropout works\n",
    "By randomly dropping/zero-ing out neurons in a layer, it has a regularising effect on the model. It prevents overfitting because the loss of certain features means the model doesn't accidentally compute very complex functions to model the relationship between $x$ and $y$.\n",

    "## Concept 4: Classification Metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve, and AUC-ROC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification tasks, we often want to evaluate the performance of our predictive model beyond just the accuracy. In some cases, we would like to minimize the number of false positives, while in other cases, we would like to minimize the number of false negatives. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in a cancer diagnosis task, we would like to minimize the number of false negatives (i.e., patients who have cancer but are diagnosed as healthy), but don't care as much for the number of false positives (i.e., patients who don't have cancer but are diagnosed as ill) because delaying cancer treatment is dangerous while suggesting a person to go through more advanced checkup poses no additional harm. On the other hand, in a spam detection task, we would like to minimize the number of false positives (i.e., emails that are not spam but are classified as spam), because users may miss out on an important email. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will delve deeper into the metrics that help us to understand how well our model is doing in different aspects: Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC Curve, and AUC-ROC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. __Precision__\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision helps us to understand the correctness of our model in predicting the positive class.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. __Recall__\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, indicates how well the model identifies positive instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. __F1-score__\n",
    "\n",
    "The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balance between the two metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{F1-Score} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\text{Precision} \\cdot \\text{Recall}}{\\text{Precision} + \\text{Recall}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. __ROC Curve__\n",
    "\n",
    "The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the true positive rate against the false positive rate, helping to visualize the performance of the binary classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. __AUC-ROC__\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) represents the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative classes; a higher AUC value indicates a better model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/Roc_curve.png\" width=500>\n",

    "A __Class Activation Map__ (CAM) is an analysis technique that lets one see through the eyes of the model. It ultimately answers the following question: \"why is the model predicting this label for a given image\". \n",
    "\n",
    "CAM creates a superimposable heatmap that's placed on top of the test image. This heatmap is coloured more strongly for areas the model is focusing on more than others and coloured less strongly for areas the model chooses to ignore.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when a picture of a dog (left) is passed through a trained ConvNet, CAM generates a heatmap (center) that's embossed on top of the image (right). The darker (redder) the region of the heatmap, the more the model focuses on that part of the image. \n",

ConvNets look out for the *most salient* features/regions in an image and give out their predictions based on that. "
